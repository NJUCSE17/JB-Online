            <p>The JB Stack Exchange is a site originally intended for we elite class students the joy and 
            sorrow about University Physics&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">as well as 
            other insane subjects.</span> Forum members are supposed to follow the following rules or they 
            shall be kicked out.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>No copying answers from others.</li>
            <li>No sharing answers if the course is marked w/&nbsp;
            <span class="badge badge-red">No answer</span>.</li>
            <li>Neither upload files violating the law nor delete others files w/o permission.</li>
            </ol>
            <h1>How to use</h1>
            <p>The JB Stack Exchange is equipped with tons of open source tools and is issued under MIT 
            license. Here are the major tips for you.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>JBEX is equipped with the latest version of MathJax. You can use LaTeX as you do problem 
            -solving assignments (note that we do not support macros and some custom functions). As an 
            example, \$...\$ would transform into an inline equation like $y = x^2$, while \$\$ ... \$\$ 
            would transform into a block equation such as $$ S = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} i$$ But if you want 
            to insert a dollar sign, just type \'\\\$\'.</li>
            <li>Highlight.JS helps we to display codes in a well-formatted way.
            <pre class="language-cpp"><code>#include 
using namespace std;
int main() {
  cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!";
  return 0;
}â€‹</code></pre>
            To insert a part of code, click \'Insert/Edit code sample\' in your editor, select your target 
            language and paste your code. It\'s simple and handy.</li>
            <li>JBEX employs ElFinder for image and file drive. If you want to insert a photo in your post, 
            just click \'Insert/edit image\', the EF2 window would pop up and you can upload your image 
            (which should be no bigger than 2 megabytes). However, everyone has the same privilege&nbsp;in 
            modifying the files, so remember to keep the folder neat and avoid deleting others\' files!&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>
